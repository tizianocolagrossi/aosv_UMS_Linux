## Instructions

### Tree

Please use:
- `doc/` for writing the final report
- `src/` for writing the sources of your project

### Project Track

The project track is available on the official site of the course at [gpm.name/teaching/2021-aosv/](https://gpm.name/teaching/2021-aosv/).

### Git LFS

This repository is already enabled for using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/), a mechanism for pushing binary files like PDFs. Therefore you can push in `doc/` images and PDFs (if you will use [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) you will put there the output). You need to:

1. Install Git LFS (`sudo apt install git-lfs` on Debian/Ubuntu)
2. Clone this repository
3. Execute `git lfs install`
4. From now on you can push and pull as usual, tracked binary files are listed in `.gitattributes` you can add other files with `git lfs track *.<extension>`

### Pull Requests

Pull requests for feedback are enabled for this repository, they are described well [here](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/leave-feedback-with-pull-requests). In practice you can create a pull request for asking clarifications to me but **you cannot abuse of this feature** and my answers are obviously limited, I cannot provide you code snippets and I cannot do the project for you. The answers to general questions will be made available to everyone in the project track page as F.A.Qs. 

### Disclaimer

If it is the first time for you to use git please **be careful**! You can lose all of your files, always keep a backup and <u style="color:red"><b>do not use git commands without really knowing what they do</u></b>!

Forgive me for any typo and good luck!
